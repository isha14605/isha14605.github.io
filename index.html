          <h4>Dry Lab Researcher + Web Developer</h4>
          <h6>iGEM Toronto</h6>
          <p>In this summer position, I worked on a machine learning model that would output protein sequences for inhbitors of coronavirus proteins. Through this experience, I learned more about various ML models, how to troubleshoot issues in code, and how to create and execute a research project. Currently, I am working as a front-end web developer for the same group, re-designing the group's website.</p>

          <p>At MedHacks 2020, I worked with a team to create a website that aims to ensure quality care during a global pandemic, by allowing patients to monitor their eye health through a virtual eye exam. I was responsible for the <span class="decoration">front-end development</span> of our project, using <span class="decoration">HTML/CSS/JavaScript</span>, <span class="decoration">Bootstrap</span>, and <span class="decoration">Heroku</span>, as well as integrating the recording functionality into the website. In addition, our team also used <span class="decoration">Google's Speech-to-Text API</span> and <span class="decoration">Google Cloud</span> in order to convert recordings of eye exams to text and store them, for processing through a scoring function that outputs a visual acuity score for the user. Our project was the <span class="special">winner of the Google COVID-19 Hackathon Fund</span> and we aim to develop it further with improvements and new features.</p>

          <h4>Protein Inhibitor Pipeline</h4>
          <p>In the Dry Lab in iGEM Toronto this summer, I developed a <span class="decoration">machine learning</span> model, built in <span class="decoration">Python</span>, that uses a transformer architecture in order to generate inhbitor protein sequences for an input protein. Before curating a dataset and writing the model, I modeled coronavirus proteins using <span class="decoration">PyMol</span>, a molecular visualization software. The dataset used consists of around 50,000 dimers from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). <span class="decoration">Numpy</span>, <span class="decoration">Pandas</span>, and <span class="decoration">TensorFlow</span> were used to load the dataset from a .csv file and into our model, called GPTProtein, which is based off of <span class="decoration">GPT2</span>, a transformer model, as mentioned earlier.</p>

          <h4>Euphoric Lyric</h4>
          <p>At Hack the 6ix 2020, my team and I worked on a <span class="decoration">machine learning</span> model that takes in an audio sample as an input and outputs lyrics that corresponds to various timestamps. To do this, we used the DALI dataset, which contains hundreds of audio files, as our input. Before we could train the model, there were many steps required in pre-processing the audio files and JSON files that were provided in this dataset, primarily done through various <span class="decoration">Python functions</span> and the <span class="decoration">audio2numpy</span> library. To construct the model, we used <span class="decoration">Keras</span>, <span class="decoration">Numpy</span>, and <span class="decoration">TensorFlow</span>.</p>

          <h4>Yelp Camp</h4>
          <p>This website serves to allow users to write reviews for campgrounds around the world and was started under a Web Development Course on Udemy. However, I am currently adding my own features to finish the application. I also plan on changing the premise of the website from focusing on reviews for campgrounds to something else (stay tuned!). Yelp Camp includes both a <span class="decoration">front-end</span> and <span class="decoration">back-end</span> and was built with many different tools and technologies, including <span class="decoration">HTML/CSS/JavaScript</span>, <span class="decoration">Bootstrap</span>, <span class="decoration">Node.js</span>, <span class="decoration">Express</span>, <span class="decoration">jQuery</span>, <span class="decoration">Heroku</span>, and <span class="decoration">MongoDB</span>. *Note: some functionality may currently be unavailable for viewing. </p>
